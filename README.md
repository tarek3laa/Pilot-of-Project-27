## Pilot-of-Project-27 Development of telemetry server software prototype

The project focus on:

* Schedule satellite operations, payload tasks, and ground data reception station
* Transmit commands to control the satellite subsystems and monitoring transmission of these commands
* Determination of satellite orbit parameters 
* Calculate trajectory (navigational) data and data for pointing Data Reception and Transmission Facilities (DRTF) antenna
* Monitoring of operation of the satellite subsystem through the processing of telemetry data received from the satellite
* Analysis statues of satellite subsystem (real time) in off-nominal situations
* synchronize  onboard time and ground time
* Perform data exchange between the FCC subsystems and DRTF
